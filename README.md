# instagram-reel-preview-discord
 
A Discord bot that posts Instagram reels (and video posts) onto Discord. <br/><br/>
`script.py` was the original version of the bot using yt-dlp (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), no longer maintained. <br/><br/>
`bot.py` is the first rewrite of the bot also using yt-dlp. I recommend using that to host the bot on a residential network. <br/><br/>
`cobalt.py` is the second rewrite (and current version) of the bot, using the Cobalt API by wukko (https://github.com/wukko/cobalt). <br/><br/>

## Prefer to try out the bot first?

You can try out by pinging ZymBot with the link you'd like to download, available on my Discord server: (https://discord.gg/YNRjVvxAXR)

If you'd like a managed hosted version of the bot I operate invited to your Discord server, please contact me. (https://linktr.ee/zymsb)
