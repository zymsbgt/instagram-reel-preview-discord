# instagram-reel-preview-discord
 
A Discord bot that posts Instagram reels (and video posts) onto Discord.
script.py was the original version of the bot using yt-dlp (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), no longer maintained.
bot.py is the first rewrite of the bot also using yt-dlp. I recommend using that to host the bot on a residential network.
cobalt.py is the second rewrite (and current version) of the bot, using the Cobalt API by wukko (https://github.com/wukko/cobalt).
